Used during development/build workflows for production builds (minify JS before deployment), optimizing bundle sizes (reduce download size and parse time), build pipelines (integrate with other Grunt tasks like concat/copy), and performance optimization (smaller files for faster page loads). Part of the grunt-contrib-* official plugin ecosystem alongside grunt-contrib-concat (concatenate files), grunt-contrib-copy (copy files), grunt-contrib-clean (delete files), grunt-contrib-watch (watch for changes). Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment without filesystem access, not a build environment. Modern minifiers like terser (ES6+ aware successor to UglifyJS), esbuild (extremely fast bundler/minifier), swc (Rust-based minifier), and uglify-js CLI (standalone UglifyJS without Grunt) have superseded Grunt workflows for JavaScript minification.",
