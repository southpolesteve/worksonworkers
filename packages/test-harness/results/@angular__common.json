  "notes": "@angular/common is part of Angular - a browser-based framework for client-side rendering. Error 'Disallowed operation called within global scope' occurs because Angular performs initialization at import time that's incompatible with Workers. Angular requires DOM/browser APIs (window, document, HttpClient) which aren't available in Workers runtime. Angular is designed for browser environments, not serverless.",
  "errorMessage": "Disallowed operation called within global scope. Asynchronous I/O (ex: fetch() or connect()), setting a timeout, and generating random values are not allowed within global scope. To fix this error, perform this operation within a handler. https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/",
