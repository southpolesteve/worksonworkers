  "notes": "Fails due to CommonJS JSON imports in @apidevtools/openapi-schemas dependency. The package loads OpenAPI JSON Schema files using require('./schema.json') pattern which doesn't work in Workers. While this is designed as a runtime library for parsing and validating Swagger/OpenAPI specs, the dependency on CommonJS JSON imports prevents it from working. Might work if properly pre-bundled with a build tool that handles JSON imports.",
