  "notes": "@babel/cli is Babel's command-line interface tool for transpiling JavaScript files from the terminal using the `babel` command. This is a build-time/development tool that requires terminal I/O (process.stdout/stderr) and is designed to transform code during development/build processes, not for runtime execution. Like webpack-cli, tsc, or esbuild CLI, this belongs in your build pipeline, not in Workers. For runtime JavaScript transformation, use @babel/standalone (browser) or pre-compile during build.",
  "errorMessage": "Use the `@babel/core` package instead of `@babel/cli`.",
