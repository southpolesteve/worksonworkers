  "notes": "@babel/parser is Babel's JavaScript/TypeScript parser that converts source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). It's used during build-time for code analysis, transpilation, linting, and code transformation tools. Like other Babel packages (@babel/core, @babel/cli), this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines, not for runtime execution in Workers. You don't parse JavaScript code in request handlers.",
