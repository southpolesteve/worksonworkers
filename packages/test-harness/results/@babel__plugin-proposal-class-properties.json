Part of Babel's code transformation ecosystem - designed for build pipelines (webpack, esbuild, vite) to transpile modern JavaScript features into older syntax. Not a runtime library. Like @babel/cli, @babel/core, and other Babel plugins, this is for development/build workflows, not serverless execution.",
