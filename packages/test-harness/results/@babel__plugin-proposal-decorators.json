  "notes": "@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators is a Babel plugin for transforming decorator syntax (e.g., `@decorator class Foo {}`, `@bound method() {}`) during build/compilation. Part of Babel's code transformation ecosystem used by build tools like webpack, esbuild, and vite to transpile experimental JavaScript features. Like all Babel plugins (@babel/plugin-transform-runtime, @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, etc.), these are build-time tools for development workflows, not runtime libraries. Not designed for or needed in Workers runtime.",
