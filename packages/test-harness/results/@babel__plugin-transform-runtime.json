  "notes": "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime is a Babel plugin used during build/compilation to optimize code by extracting helper functions to @babel/runtime. Part of Babel's code transformation ecosystem used by build tools like webpack, esbuild, and vite to reduce bundle size by deduplicating Babel helper functions across modules. Like all Babel plugins (@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators, @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, etc.), these are build-time tools for development workflows, not runtime libraries. Error 'Expected opts.sync to be a function' occurs because Babel plugins expect to run in a Node.js build environment with filesystem access.",
