  "notes": "@babel/preset-env is a Babel preset (collection of Babel plugins) that automatically determines which JavaScript features need transpilation based on target browser/runtime environments. It's a configuration tool used during build/compilation with @babel/core to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+) to ES5 or other compatibility levels. Like all Babel presets (@babel/preset-react, @babel/preset-typescript, @babel/preset-flow), this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines (webpack, esbuild, vite), not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development.",
