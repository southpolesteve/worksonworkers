  "notes": "@babel/preset-react is a Babel preset (collection of Babel plugins) for transforming React JSX syntax (e.g., `<div>Hello</div>`, `<Component prop={value} />`) to JavaScript function calls during build/compilation. Part of Babel's code transformation ecosystem used by build tools like webpack, esbuild, and vite to transpile JSX. Like all Babel presets (@babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-typescript, @babel/preset-flow), this is a build-time tool for development workflows, not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development. Error 'Expected opts.sync to be a function' occurs because Babel presets expect to run in a Node.js build environment. Not designed for or needed in Cloudflare Workers runtime.",
