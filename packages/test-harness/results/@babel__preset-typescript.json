  "notes": "@babel/preset-typescript is a Babel preset (collection of Babel plugins) for transforming TypeScript syntax (type annotations, interfaces, enums, decorators, etc.) to JavaScript during build/compilation. Part of Babel's code transformation ecosystem used by build tools like webpack, esbuild, and vite to transpile TypeScript. Like all Babel presets (@babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-react, @babel/preset-flow), this is a build-time tool for development workflows, not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development.",
