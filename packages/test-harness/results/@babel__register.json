  "notes": "@babel/register is a Node.js require hook that automatically transpiles files on-the-fly during development. It intercepts Node's require() system to compile ES6+/JSX/TypeScript code using Babel before execution. Like ts-node or nodemon, this is a development convenience tool for local Node.js development environments, not a runtime library. You configure it in development scripts (e.g., node -r @babel/register app.js) to avoid pre-compilation during development. In production Workers deployments, code is pre-compiled during build time using bundlers (esbuild, webpack, etc.), making this package unnecessary and incompatible.",
