  "notes": "@babel/runtime-corejs2 is a Babel runtime helper package that provides extracted helper functions and core-js v2 polyfills. It's used as a dependency by @babel/plugin-transform-runtime during build/compilation to externalize Babel helper functions (like _classCallCheck, _extends, _objectSpread) and inject polyfills for ES6+ features (Promise, Symbol, etc.). Like @babel/runtime and @babel/runtime-corejs3, this is part of the build toolchain - you configure it in your Babel setup during development, and the bundler includes only the needed helpers/polyfills in the final bundle. Not a runtime library for direct use in Workers.",
