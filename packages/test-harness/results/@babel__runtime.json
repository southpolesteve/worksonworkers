  "notes": "@babel/runtime is a Babel runtime helper package that provides extracted helper functions (like _classCallCheck, _extends, _objectSpread, etc.) used by @babel/plugin-transform-runtime during build/compilation. It's used as a dependency to externalize Babel helper functions, reducing bundle size by deduplicating helpers across modules. Like @babel/plugin-transform-runtime, this is part of the build toolchain - you configure it in your Babel setup during development, and the bundler includes only the needed helpers in the final bundle. Not a runtime library for direct use in Workers. The package intentionally has no default export (missing '.' specifier) since you're meant to import specific helpers like '@babel/runtime/helpers/classCallCheck', which the Babel plugin does automatically during build time.",
