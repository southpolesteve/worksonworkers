  "notes": "@babel/traverse is part of Babel's core AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal and transformation system. It provides the API for walking through and transforming code trees during build/compilation. Like @babel/parser, @babel/core, and other Babel packages, this is a build-time tool used by Babel plugins and build systems (webpack, esbuild, vite) to analyze and transform code. Not a runtime library - you don't traverse ASTs in request handlers.",
