  "notes": "@babel/types is Babel's utility library for Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes. It provides Lodash-like helper functions for creating, validating, and manipulating AST nodes during code transformation. Part of Babel's core build-time ecosystem used by Babel plugins, parsers, and code transformation tools. Like @babel/parser, @babel/traverse, and @babel/core, this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines (webpack, esbuild, vite), not for runtime execution in Workers. You don't work with AST nodes in request handlers.",
