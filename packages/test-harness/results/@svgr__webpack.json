  "notes": "@svgr/webpack is a webpack loader that transforms SVG files into React components during build/compilation. Part of SVGR's webpack integration used by build tools to process SVG imports (e.g., `import Logo from './logo.svg'`) at build time. Like all webpack loaders (babel-loader, css-loader, file-loader, ts-loader), this is a build-time tool for development workflows, not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in webpack.config.js during development. Error 'Expected opts.sync to be a function' occurs because webpack loaders expect to run in a Node.js build environment with webpack's loader API.",
