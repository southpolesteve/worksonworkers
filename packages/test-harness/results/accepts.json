  "notes": "HTTP content negotiation library used by Express. Depends on mime-types which uses CommonJS require('./db.json') that doesn't work in Workers. The mime-db package loads a 182KB JSON database via require() which fails even with nodejs_compat. This is a legitimate runtime library for content negotiation (Accept headers, charsets, encodings, languages). Might work if properly pre-bundled with a bundler that can inline the JSON. For now, genuinely broken due to CommonJS JSON import limitations.",
