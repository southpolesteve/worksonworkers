  "notes": "AngularJS 1.x is a browser-only framework for client-side rendering. Requires DOM APIs (window, document, Element, HTMLElement) which are not available in Workers. This is the legacy AngularJS framework (v1.x), not to be confused with modern Angular (v2+). Both are designed for browser environments, not serverless. Error 'window is not defined' confirms browser dependency. For building apps on Workers, use edge-compatible frameworks like Remix, SolidStart, Hono, or itty-router.",
