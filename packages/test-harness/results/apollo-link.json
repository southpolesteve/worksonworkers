  "notes": "apollo-link is the core interface/base class for Apollo Client v2's modular link architecture (apollo-link, apollo-link-http, apollo-link-ws, apollo-link-state, etc.). Published 6 years ago (2018) as part of the split Apollo Client v2 system where each transport/middleware was a separate package. Apollo Client v3+ (released 2020) unified all these packages into a single @apollo/client package with better TypeScript support, improved caching, and modern React hooks. This package is deprecated infrastructure - use @apollo/client instead.",
