  "notes": "awesome-typescript-loader is a webpack loader for transpiling TypeScript files during the webpack build process. It's a build-time tool used in webpack.config.js (e.g., { test: /\\.tsx?$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }) to handle TypeScript compilation with webpack. Like all webpack loaders (ts-loader, babel-loader, css-loader, file-loader, etc.), this is designed for build/development workflows, not runtime execution in Workers. The package is also archived/deprecated - the TypeScript team recommends using ts-loader instead.",
