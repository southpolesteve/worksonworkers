  "notes": "aws-sdk (v2) is the legacy monolithic AWS SDK for JavaScript - now deprecated and replaced by AWS SDK v3. v2 requires node:punycode which isn't available in Workers' nodejs_compat. More importantly, AWS SDK v2 is a massive monolithic package importing ALL AWS services (~50MB+), making it unsuitable for edge/serverless. AWS SDK v3 (@aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb, @aws-sdk/client-sqs, etc.) is modular, tree-shakeable, and specifically designed to work in browser/edge environments including Workers. Use the specific @aws-sdk/client-* packages for the AWS services you need.",
