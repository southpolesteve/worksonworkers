  "notes": "babel-cli (v6.26.0) is the legacy Babel 6 command-line interface tool for transpiling JavaScript files from the terminal using the `babel` command. Babel 6 has been replaced by Babel 7+ (@babel/cli). Like all CLI build tools (webpack-cli, tsc, esbuild CLI), this is a build-time tool requiring terminal I/O (process.stdout/stderr), designed to transform code during development/build processes, not for runtime execution in Workers.",
