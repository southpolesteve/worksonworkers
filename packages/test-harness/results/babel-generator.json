  "notes": "babel-generator (v6.26.1) is the legacy Babel 6 code generator that converts Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) back to JavaScript source code - now replaced by @babel/generator (Babel 7+). Part of Babel's build-time code transformation pipeline used by Babel plugins, @babel/core, and other build tools (webpack, esbuild) to generate JavaScript output after transforming the AST. Like all Babel packages (@babel/core, @babel/parser, @babel/traverse), this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines, not for runtime execution in Workers. You don't generate JavaScript source code from AST nodes in request handlers.",
