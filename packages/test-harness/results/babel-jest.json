  "notes": "babel-jest is a Jest transformer that uses Babel to compile JavaScript/TypeScript during test execution. Part of Jest's test runner ecosystem used by jest CLI to transpile source files before running tests. Like all Jest transformers (@jest/transform, ts-jest) and test frameworks (jest, mocha, jasmine, vitest), this is a build-time/testing tool for development workflows, not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in jest.config.js (e.g., transform: { '^.+\\.jsx?$': 'babel-jest' }) to tell Jest how to process files during test runs.",
