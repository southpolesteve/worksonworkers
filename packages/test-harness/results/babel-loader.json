  "notes": "babel-loader is a webpack loader that uses Babel to transpile JavaScript/TypeScript files during the webpack build process. It's a bridge between webpack and @babel/core, allowing webpack to process JavaScript through Babel transformations. Like all webpack loaders (ts-loader, css-loader, file-loader, vue-loader, etc.), this is a build-time tool designed for development/build workflows with webpack.config.js, not for runtime execution in Workers. You configure it in webpack config (e.g., { test: /\\.jsx?$/, loader: 'babel-loader' }) to handle code transpilation during bundling.",
