  "notes": "babel-plugin-import is a Babel plugin that automatically transforms imports to enable tree-shaking for component libraries like antd, lodash, and material-ui. For example, it transforms `import { Button } from 'antd'` to `import Button from 'antd/lib/button'` during build/compilation to reduce bundle size. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-*, @babel/plugin-*, babel-plugin-transform-*, etc.), this is a build-time tool configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js for code transformation during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Not a runtime library for Workers execution.",
