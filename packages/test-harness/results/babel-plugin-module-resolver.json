  "notes": "babel-plugin-module-resolver is a Babel plugin that rewrites import paths (aliases) during build/compilation. For example, it transforms import '../../../components/Button' to import '@/components/Button' based on .babelrc configuration. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-*, @babel/plugin-*), this is a build-time tool configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js for code transformation during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Not a runtime library for Workers execution.",
