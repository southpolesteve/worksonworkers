  "notes": "babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator is a Babel 6 plugin that transforms async/await syntax (e.g., async function foo() { await bar(); }) to generator functions with helper utilities during build/compilation. Babel transform plugins (babel-plugin-transform-*, @babel/plugin-transform-*) are code transformation tools that modify JavaScript during the build process. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-syntax-*, @babel/plugin-proposal-*, @babel/preset-*), these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. async/await is now natively supported in modern JavaScript/Workers. Not a runtime library for Workers execution.",
