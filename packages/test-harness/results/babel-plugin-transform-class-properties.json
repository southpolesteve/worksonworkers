  "notes": "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties is a Babel 6 plugin that transforms class properties syntax (e.g., class Foo { bar = 42; static baz = 123; }) to constructor assignments during build/compilation. Babel transform plugins (babel-plugin-transform-*, @babel/plugin-transform-*) are code transformation tools that modify JavaScript during the build process. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-syntax-*, @babel/plugin-proposal-*, @babel/preset-*), these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Class properties are now natively supported in modern JavaScript/Workers. In Babel 7+, this functionality is in @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.",
