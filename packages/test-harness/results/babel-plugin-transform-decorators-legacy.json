  "notes": "babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy is a Babel 6 plugin that transforms decorator syntax (e.g., @decorator class Foo {}, @readonly method() {}) to ES5-compatible code during build/compilation. Babel transform plugins (babel-plugin-transform-*, @babel/plugin-transform-*) are code transformation tools that modify JavaScript during the build process. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-syntax-*, @babel/plugin-proposal-*, @babel/preset-*), these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Decorators are still experimental in JavaScript. In Babel 7+, use @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators.",
