  "notes": "babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types is a Babel plugin that removes React PropTypes declarations from production builds to reduce bundle size. For example, it transforms `Component.propTypes = { name: PropTypes.string }` to remove the PropTypes assignments during build/compilation. Babel transform plugins (babel-plugin-transform-*, @babel/plugin-transform-*) are code transformation tools that modify JavaScript during the build process. Like all Babel plugins (babel-plugin-syntax-*, @babel/plugin-proposal-*, @babel/preset-*), these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. PropTypes are typically stripped in production builds. Not a runtime library for Workers execution.",
