  "notes": "babel-preset-es2015 is a Babel 6 preset that automatically configures Babel plugins to transform ES6/ES2015 features (arrow functions, classes, destructuring, template literals, const/let, modules, etc.) to ES5-compatible JavaScript. Babel presets (babel-preset-*, @babel/preset-*) are collections of Babel plugins bundled together for convenience. Like all Babel plugins and presets, these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Modern JavaScript runtimes including Workers natively support ES2015 features. In Babel 7+, replaced by @babel/preset-env.",
