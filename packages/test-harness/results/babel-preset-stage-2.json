  "notes": "babel-preset-stage-2 is a Babel 6 preset that enables TC39 Stage 2 (draft) JavaScript language features by bundling together Stage 2 and 3 preset plugins. Stage 2 proposals include features like class decorators, numeric separators, and other draft-stage features that have a high likelihood of eventually being included in the standard. Babel presets (babel-preset-*, @babel/preset-*) are collections of Babel plugins bundled together for convenience. Like all Babel plugins and presets, these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Stage presets were deprecated and removed in Babel 7+ as the TC39 process matured and individual plugin usage became preferred. Not applicable for Workers runtime - this is build infrastructure.",
