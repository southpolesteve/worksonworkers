  "notes": "babel-preset-stage-3 is a Babel 6 preset that enables TC39 Stage 3 (candidate) JavaScript language features by bundling together Stage 3 preset plugins. Stage 3 proposals include features like async generator functions, object rest/spread, dynamic import(), etc. - features that have a high likelihood of being included in the standard but are still awaiting final approval. Babel presets (babel-preset-*, @babel/preset-*) are collections of Babel plugins bundled together for convenience. Like all Babel plugins and presets, these are build-time tools configured in .babelrc or babel.config.js during development/build pipelines with webpack, vite, or esbuild. Stage presets were deprecated and removed in Babel 7+ as the TC39 process matured and individual plugin usage became preferred.",
