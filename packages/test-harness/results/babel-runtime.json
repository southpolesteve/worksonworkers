  "notes": "babel-runtime is a Babel 6 package containing runtime helper functions and polyfills (regenerator-runtime, core-js) that Babel plugins inject into transpiled code during build/compilation. It's used by babel-plugin-transform-runtime to avoid duplicating Babel helper code (like _extends, _asyncToGenerator, _classCallCheck) across multiple output files by extracting them into importable modules from babel-runtime. Like all Babel packages (babel-core, @babel/plugin-*, babel-preset-*, etc.), this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines, not for runtime execution in Workers. In Babel 7+, replaced by @babel/runtime.",
