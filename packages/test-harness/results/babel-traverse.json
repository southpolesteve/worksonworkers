  "notes": "babel-traverse is a Babel 6 AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal library that provides utilities for walking through and manipulating ASTs during code transformation - now replaced by @babel/traverse in Babel 7+. Used by @babel/core and Babel plugins to visit/modify specific AST node types (e.g., traverse(ast, { FunctionDeclaration(path) { /* transform */ } })) during the build-time transpilation pipeline. Like all Babel packages (babel-core, babel-generator, babel-types, @babel/parser), this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines, not for runtime execution in Workers.",
