  "notes": "babel (v6.23.0) is a legacy Babel 6 CLI wrapper package that redirects to babel-core for the Node.js API and babel-cli for command-line usage. The package itself contains no actual implementation - it's just a placeholder that throws 'The node API for `babel` has been moved to `babel-core`'. In Babel 7+, use @babel/core for the API and @babel/cli for the CLI. Like all Babel packages, this is a build-time tool for development workflows and build pipelines, not for runtime execution in Workers.",
