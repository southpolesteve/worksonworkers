  "notes": "babelify is a Browserify transform (stream-based plugin) that integrates Babel into the Browserify bundling pipeline to transpile JavaScript during build/compilation. Browserify is a build tool that bundles Node.js-style modules using require() for browser usage, and babelify extends it with Babel's transpilation capabilities (ES6+ to ES5, JSX, TypeScript, etc.). Like all build-time tools (browserify, webpack, rollup, esbuild, babel-loader, ts-loader), this is designed for development/build workflows configured in package.json scripts or Gulp/Grunt tasks, not for runtime execution in Workers. The error 'Expected opts.sync to be a function' occurs because it expects to run in Browserify's streaming build environment. Modern build tools have largely replaced Browserify.",
