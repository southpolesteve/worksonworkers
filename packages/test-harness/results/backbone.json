  "notes": "Backbone.js is a browser-only MV* framework from 2010 for building single-page applications with models, views, collections, and routers. Requires DOM APIs (window, document, Element) which are not available in Workers. Designed for client-side rendering in browsers, not serverless environments. Modern alternatives include React, Vue, Svelte for browser-side rendering, or server-side frameworks like Hono, Remix, or Next.js for Workers. Original error 'spawn npm ENOENT' was a test infrastructure issue.",
