Designed for build-time/Node.js server environments to process large JSON files without blocking the event loop. Not applicable to Workers which lack persistent filesystem access and operate in a stateless request/response model. For JSON processing in Workers, use standard JSON.parse/JSON.stringify or the Streams API for streaming large payloads.",
