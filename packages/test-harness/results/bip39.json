  "notes": "Bitcoin BIP39 library for mnemonic code generation. The package fails in Workers because validateMnemonic() returns false even for known-valid mnemonics like the standard test vector 'abandon abandon...'. This suggests the English wordlist (required for validation) is not loading properly - likely due to CommonJS JSON imports (require('./wordlists/english.json')) in the package's dependencies. The bip39 package depends on loading a 2048-word English dictionary at runtime which doesn't work in Workers' bundled environment.",
