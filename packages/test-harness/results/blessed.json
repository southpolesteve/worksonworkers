  "notes": "blessed is a high-level terminal interface library for Node.js that enables building interactive TUI (Text User Interface) applications with curses-like functionality. Designed exclusively for CLI/terminal applications requiring terminal APIs (process.stdout/stdin, TTY control, ANSI escape sequences, terminal dimensions, keyboard events, mouse events). Not applicable to Workers which is a serverless HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. For building terminal UIs, run blessed applications in Node.js environments. Similar terminal UI libraries include ink (React-based), blessed-contrib (charts/widgets), neo-blessed (blessed fork).",
