  "notes": "Bottleneck is a task scheduler and rate limiter for Node.js and browsers that provides concurrency control (maxConcurrent), request throttling (minTime), and Redis Clustering support. The package genuinely doesn't work in Workers due to a syntax error (\"Unexpected token ':'\") during import/parsing. This indicates the package's ES module build contains invalid or incompatible JavaScript syntax that Workers' bundler/runtime cannot parse. The package was last published 6 years ago (2018) and may use older build tooling that doesn't produce Workers-compatible output. For rate limiting in Workers, use p-limit (concurrent promise limiting), p-queue (promise queue with concurrency control), or implement custom rate limiting using Durable Objects for distributed state.",
