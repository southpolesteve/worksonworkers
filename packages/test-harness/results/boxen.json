  "notes": "boxen is a terminal/CLI utility for creating ASCII/Unicode bordered boxes around text in terminal output (stdout). Designed exclusively for command-line interfaces and Node.js terminal applications using process.stdout, terminal width detection, ANSI escape codes, and TTY control. Not applicable to Workers which is an HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. Similar CLI box/styling libraries include cli-boxes, boxen-cli, chalk (colors), ora (spinners). The original error 'Unexpected token ':'' occurred during import/parsing, but this is irrelevant since the package is fundamentally a CLI tool.",
