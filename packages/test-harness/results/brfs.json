  "notes": "brfs is a Browserify transform (build-time plugin) that inlines fs.readFileSync() and fs.readFile() calls into JavaScript bundles during the build process. It parses the AST to replace filesystem reads with their static content at compile-time (e.g., transforms `fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/file.txt', 'utf8')` to `var content = \"file contents here\"`). Like all Browserify transforms (babelify, envify, etc.) and build tools (browserify, webpack, rollup), this is designed for development/build workflows, not runtime execution in Workers. Modern bundlers (webpack, vite, esbuild) handle static asset imports natively.",
