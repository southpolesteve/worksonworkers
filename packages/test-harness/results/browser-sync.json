  "notes": "browser-sync is a development server tool that provides live browser reloading and synchronization during development. It creates a local HTTP server, watches files for changes, opens/controls real browsers, and injects scripts to auto-reload browsers when files change. Requires filesystem watching (to detect changes), HTTP server capabilities (to serve files), browser automation (to open/reload browsers), and terminal I/O (for CLI usage). Like all dev server tools (webpack-dev-server, vite dev server, live-server, http-server), this is designed for local development workflows, not for runtime execution in Workers.",
