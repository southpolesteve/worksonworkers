  "notes": "Browserify is a build tool that bundles Node.js-style modules (using require()) into a single JavaScript file for browser usage. It processes module dependency graphs, applies transforms (like babelify, envify), and creates browser-compatible bundles during build/compilation. Like all bundlers (webpack, rollup, esbuild, parcel), this is designed for development/build workflows configured via CLI (browserify entry.js -o bundle.js) or build scripts, not for runtime execution in Workers. Modern build tools (webpack, vite, esbuild) have largely replaced Browserify. Original error 'No such module \"node:os\"' occurred because browserify requires Node.js filesystem and OS APIs for bundling operations.",
