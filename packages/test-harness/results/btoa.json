  "notes": "btoa() is a native Web API function for base64 encoding (binary-to-ASCII) that's already built into Cloudflare Workers. The 'btoa' npm package was created as a polyfill for Node.js environments that didn't have btoa natively. Workers provides native btoa()/atob() functions - no package installation needed. Simply use: btoa('hello') to encode, atob('aGVsbG8=') to decode.",
