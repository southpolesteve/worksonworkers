  "notes": "Chart.js is a browser-only data visualization library that renders interactive charts using HTML5 Canvas (<canvas> element). Requires DOM APIs (window, document, HTMLCanvasElement, CanvasRenderingContext2D) which are not available in Workers. Designed for client-side chart rendering in browsers, not serverless environments. For data visualization in Workers, return data to client for rendering with Chart.js/Recharts/D3, or use server-side chart generation libraries that don't require Canvas.",
