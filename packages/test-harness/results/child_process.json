  "notes": "child_process is a polyfill/wrapper for Node.js's built-in child_process module which spawns external processes (exec, spawn, fork, execFile). Cloudflare Workers is a sandboxed serverless environment that does not allow spawning child processes for security and isolation reasons. The nodejs_compat flag provides child_process as a non-functional stub that throws errors when used. Process spawning requires an operating system with process management (fork, exec syscalls), filesystem access, and unrestricted system resources - none of which are available in Workers' V8 isolate-based runtime. Not applicable to Workers. For background tasks, use Durable Objects, Queues, or external services.",
