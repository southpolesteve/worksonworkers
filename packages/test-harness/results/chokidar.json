  "notes": "chokidar is a filesystem watcher library for Node.js that monitors files/directories and emits events when they change (add, change, unlink). Used by build tools (webpack-dev-server, vite, parcel, rollup watch mode) to detect file changes and trigger hot reloading/rebuilds during development. Requires persistent filesystem access (fs.watch, fs.watchFile) and OS APIs (node:os) which are not available in Workers. Workers is a stateless serverless environment without persistent filesystem to watch. For real-time updates in Workers, use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or Durable Objects.",
