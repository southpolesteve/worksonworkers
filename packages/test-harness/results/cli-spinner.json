  "notes": "cli-spinner is a terminal/CLI utility for displaying animated spinners in command-line output (stdout). Designed exclusively for command-line interfaces and Node.js terminal applications requiring process.stdout, TTY control, and ANSI escape codes. Not applicable to Workers which is an HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. Similar CLI spinner libraries include ora, cli-spinners, nanospinner, progress. The original error was a test configuration issue, but this is irrelevant since the package is fundamentally a CLI tool.",
