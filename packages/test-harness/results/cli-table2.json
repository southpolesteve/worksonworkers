Renders ASCII/Unicode tables with customizable borders, colors, and column alignment for displaying tabular data in terminal/console applications. Designed exclusively for command-line interfaces and Node.js terminal applications requiring process.stdout, TTY control, and terminal width detection. Not applicable to Workers which is an HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. Similar CLI table libraries include cli-table, cli-table3, table, columnify, easy-table. For data formatting in Workers, use JSON responses or HTML tables.",
