  "notes": "cli is a CLI framework/toolkit for building command-line applications with Node.js. Provides utilities for parsing arguments, interactive prompts, progress bars, colored output, and terminal I/O via process.stdout/stdin. Designed exclusively for command-line interfaces and terminal applications requiring TTY control, terminal dimensions, ANSI escape codes, and filesystem access. Not applicable to Workers which is a serverless HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. Similar CLI frameworks include commander, yargs, oclif, inquirer, vorpal. For HTTP APIs in Workers, use Hono, itty-router, or Cloudflare's native fetch API.",
