Requires browser APIs like document, window, HTMLElement, and clipboard APIs (document.execCommand('copy') or navigator.clipboard). Designed exclusively for client-side browser environments to interact with the user's clipboard for copy-to-clipboard functionality in web applications. Not applicable to Workers which is a serverless HTTP runtime without DOM APIs or access to the system clipboard. For clipboard functionality, implement client-side in the browser using clipboard.js. Similar browser-only clipboard libraries include copy-to-clipboard, clipboard-copy.",
