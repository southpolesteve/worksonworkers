  "notes": "clipboardy is a CLI tool for accessing the system clipboard (copy/paste) that spawns native clipboard commands (pbcopy/pbpaste on macOS, xclip/xsel on Linux, clip.exe on Windows) via child_process.spawn(). Requires child_process for spawning system clipboard utilities and OS-level APIs for clipboard access. Workers doesn't support child_process (non-functional stub) or system clipboard APIs. Designed exclusively for CLI/terminal applications and local development scripting requiring system clipboard interaction. Not applicable to Workers which is a serverless HTTP runtime without access to system resources. Similar CLI clipboard tools include clipboard-cli, clipcopy.",
