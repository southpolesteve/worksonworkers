  "notes": "colors is a terminal/CLI coloring and formatting utility for console output. Provides functions for adding colors (red, blue, green, etc.) and styling (bold, italic, underline) to terminal/stdout text using ANSI escape codes. Designed exclusively for command-line interfaces and Node.js terminal applications requiring process.stdout, TTY control, and ANSI color support. Not applicable to Workers which is an HTTP request/response runtime without terminal I/O. Similar CLI styling libraries include chalk, kleur, ansi-colors, picocolors, cli-color. Original error \"No such module \\\"node:os\\\"\" occurred because colors uses the os module which is not available in Workers.",
