  "notes": "configstore is a CLI/dev tool library for storing and persisting configuration data for command-line applications. It writes JSON configuration files to disk in the user's home directory (e.g., ~/.config/configstore/app-name.json) and requires filesystem persistence, node:os module (for os.homedir()), and file I/O operations. Not applicable to Workers which is a stateless serverless environment without persistent filesystem access or os module. Original error \"No such module \\\"node:os\\\"\" occurred because the os module is not available in Workers even with nodejs_compat. For configuration in Workers, use environment variables (wrangler.toml, secrets), KV storage, or Durable Objects.",
