  "notes": "Connect is a middleware framework for Node.js HTTP servers that works with Node's http.createServer() to compose middleware chains. Designed for traditional Node.js server applications requiring http/https modules, server lifecycle management (listen, close), and IncomingMessage/ServerResponse objects. Workers uses a fetch handler model (addEventListener('fetch', ...)) instead of Node's HTTP server pattern - there's no http.createServer() or server instance to pass to connect(). Connect middleware expects Node's req/res objects with specific properties (req.url, req.method, req.headers, res.writeHead, res.end) which differ from Workers' Request/Response APIs. For middleware in Workers, use Hono (full-featured web framework with middleware), itty-router (lightweight routing with middleware), or implement custom middleware using native fetch handlers.",
