  "notes": "cross-env is a CLI utility for setting environment variables consistently across different operating systems/platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). Used in npm scripts to set NODE_ENV and other environment variables (e.g., cross-env NODE_ENV=production node app.js). Spawns child processes via child_process.spawn() to execute commands with modified environment variables. Designed exclusively for development/build workflows in package.json scripts, not for runtime execution in Workers. Similar cross-platform CLI utilities include env-cmd, dotenv-cli, cross-var. For environment configuration in Workers, use wrangler.toml [vars] section, Wrangler secrets (for sensitive values), or hardcoded environment objects.",
