  "notes": "cross-spawn is a cross-platform wrapper around Node.js child_process.spawn() for spawning child processes. Handles cross-platform differences in command execution (Windows vs Unix). Requires child_process module which is not available in Workers (spawning processes requires OS process management). Used by tools like execa, npm-run-all, and concurrently. Not applicable to Workers' sandboxed serverless environment.",
