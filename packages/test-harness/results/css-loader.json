  "notes": "css-loader is a webpack loader for processing CSS files during the webpack build process. It interprets @import and url() in CSS files, resolves module dependencies, and transforms CSS into JavaScript modules. Like all webpack loaders (*-loader pattern: style-loader, sass-loader, file-loader, babel-loader), this is designed for development/build workflows configured in webpack.config.js as part of the module.rules array, not for runtime execution in Workers. Modern bundlers (webpack, vite, esbuild) handle CSS imports during build time.",
