  "notes": "detect-port is a CLI/dev tool utility for finding available network ports on a local machine. It checks if a port is occupied and returns an available alternative port. Used extensively by development servers (webpack-dev-server, create-react-app, gatsby, storybook, vite, umi, flipper, micro) to automatically find free ports during local development. Requires network port binding via net.createServer() to test port availability and OS-level network APIs which are not available in Workers' serverless environment. Workers is an HTTP request/response runtime without access to network port binding or server lifecycle management. Similar port detection utilities include get-port, portfinder, port-scanner. Not applicable to Workers which doesn't have network server capabilities.",
