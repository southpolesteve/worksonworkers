  "notes": "discord.js is a Discord bot library that requires persistent WebSocket connections to Discord's Gateway API for real-time events (listening to messages, presence updates, voice state changes, etc.). Designed for long-running Node.js bot applications that maintain always-on Gateway connections. Workers is a stateless serverless environment without support for persistent WebSocket connections or long-running processes. The main discord.js package uses @discordjs/ws for Gateway WebSocket management which is incompatible with Workers' request/response lifecycle. Note: The discord.js website shows 'Powered by Cloudflare Workers' because their documentation site is hosted on Workers, not because the bot library works on Workers. For Discord interactions on Workers, use @discordjs/rest (REST API only) or @discordjs/core (thin wrapper for REST + webhook-based interactions). These packages support slash commands, webhooks, and REST API calls without requiring Gateway connections.",
  "alternative": "@discordjs/rest or @discordjs/core for REST-only Discord interactions (slash commands, webhooks)",
