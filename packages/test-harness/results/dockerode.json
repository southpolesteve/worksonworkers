  "notes": "dockerode is a Docker Remote API client library for programmatic control of Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. Requires network access to Docker daemon (unix socket or HTTP/TCP), filesystem operations for container tar archives (uses tar-fs for copying files to/from containers), and Docker daemon connectivity which doesn't exist in Workers' serverless environment. Designed for Docker automation, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and development tooling that manage Docker infrastructure. Not applicable to Workers which is a stateless serverless HTTP runtime without access to Docker daemon or container management capabilities. Similar Docker client libraries include dockerode alternatives (dockerode-compose), Kubernetes clients (kubernetes-client), or container management SDKs.",
