  "notes": "Pure JavaScript elliptic curve cryptography library for ECDSA, EdDSA, and ECDH operations. Supports curves: secp256k1, p192, p224, p256, p384, p521, curve25519, ed25519. Fails with 'Unexpected token \":\"' parse error when bundled for Workers - likely due to code incompatible with Workers runtime. Workers has the built-in Web Crypto API (crypto.subtle) which provides native elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA with P-256/P-384/P-521, ECDH) with better performance and security than pure JavaScript implementations.",
