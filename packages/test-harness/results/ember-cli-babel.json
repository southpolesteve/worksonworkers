  "notes": "ember-cli-babel is an Ember CLI plugin (build-time tool) that uses Babel and @babel/preset-env to transpile JavaScript code during the Ember CLI build process. It's configured in ember-cli-build.js as part of the Ember CLI build pipeline. Transpilation happens during development/build time, not at runtime. Similar build-time transpilation tools include babel-loader (webpack), @vitejs/plugin-react (vite), and other framework-specific Babel plugins. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build tool. Modern bundlers (wrangler, webpack, vite, esbuild) handle JavaScript transpilation during the build step.",
