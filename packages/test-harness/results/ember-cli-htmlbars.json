Provides custom AST transform registration and integrates with ember-template-compiler. Like all framework-specific build plugins (vue-loader for webpack, svelte-loader, @angular/compiler-cli), this is designed for development/build workflows, not runtime execution. Template compilation happens during the build step before deployment. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment.",
