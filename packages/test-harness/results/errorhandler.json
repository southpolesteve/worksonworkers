  "notes": "Express/Connect middleware for development-only error handling. Designed for traditional Node.js HTTP servers with Express/Connect (requires req/res objects from http.createServer). Provides formatted error responses with stack traces, content negotiation (HTML/JSON/plain text), and console.error logging. Workers uses fetch handler model with Request/Response objects, not Express middleware pattern. For error handling in Workers, use try/catch blocks in fetch handlers and return custom Response objects with error details.",
