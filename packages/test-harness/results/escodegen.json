  "notes": "JavaScript code generator from AST (Mozilla Parser API). Part of the AST tooling ecosystem used during build/compilation workflows. Takes Abstract Syntax Trees (from parsers like esprima/acorn) and generates JavaScript code. Primarily used by transpilers (Babel), bundlers (webpack/rollup), code transformation tools, and AST manipulation utilities during build time. Used for source transformations, code generation, AST-based refactoring tools. Similar AST tools: esprima (parser), acorn (parser), recast (AST transformation). For code generation in Workers, generate code at build time or return raw strings. Fails with \"Unexpected token ':'\" syntax error when bundled for Workers runtime.",
