  "notes": "ESLint plugin that runs Prettier as an ESLint rule. Integrates Prettier code formatter into ESLint workflows by reporting formatting differences as ESLint errors. Configured in .eslintrc via plugins: ['prettier'] and rules: {'prettier/prettier': 'error'}. Used exclusively during development/CI workflows to enforce Prettier formatting standards through ESLint. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a linting environment. Similar ESLint-formatter integrations include eslint-plugin-standard, eslint-config-prettier (disables conflicting ESLint formatting rules).",
