  "notes": "ESLint plugin for React-specific linting rules (jsx-uses-react, react-in-jsx-scope, prop-types, jsx-key, no-unused-state, hooks rules, etc.). ESLint plugins extend ESLint's rule set via the 'plugins' array in .eslintrc or eslint.config.js configuration files. Used exclusively during development/CI workflows to enforce React best practices and catch common React mistakes. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a linting environment. Similar ESLint React plugins include eslint-plugin-react-hooks (React Hooks rules), eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y (accessibility rules).",
