  "notes": "esm is a Node.js module loader that enables ES modules (import/export) in legacy CommonJS environments. It hooks into Node.js's require() system to transpile ES module syntax to CommonJS at runtime using dynamic code generation (eval/Function constructor) which is blocked in Workers. Designed for older Node.js versions (<14) that lacked native ES module support. Modern Node.js and Workers have native ES module support built-in - no loader needed. Similar legacy module loaders include @std/esm (predecessor), babel-register (Babel transpilation), ts-node (TypeScript transpilation). Not applicable to Workers which already has full native ES module support.",
