  "notes": "Express is a Node.js web framework designed for traditional HTTP servers using http.createServer(). While Express has some Workers support via @cloudflare/workers-web-api bridge, it's not optimized for Workers' serverless environment. Express relies on Node.js middleware patterns (req, res, next) and expects persistent server processes. Workers uses fetch event handlers with Request/Response objects and stateless execution. Bundle size overhead is significant. Better alternatives exist that are purpose-built for Workers with better performance, smaller bundle sizes, and native Workers integration.",
