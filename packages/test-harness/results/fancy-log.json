Used during development/build processes to log task execution with color-coded timestamps. Part of Gulp task runner tooling (gulp, gulp-*, vinyl-fs). Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build environment. For runtime logging in Workers, use console.log/error/warn directly or structured logging libraries like pino.",
