  "notes": "Webpack loader for importing files during webpack compilation. Configured in webpack.config.js module.rules to emit files and return URLs during webpack builds. Like all webpack loaders (*-loader pattern: style-loader, babel-loader, css-loader, sass-loader), this is designed exclusively for development/build workflows, not runtime execution in Workers. Modern bundlers handle file imports during build time. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build environment.",
