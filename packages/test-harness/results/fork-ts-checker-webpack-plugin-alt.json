  "notes": "Webpack plugin for running TypeScript type checking in a separate process. The name pattern '*-webpack-plugin' clearly indicates it's a webpack build tool (like html-webpack-plugin, copy-webpack-plugin, extract-text-webpack-plugin). Configured in webpack.config.js as a plugin: new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin(). Used during development/build workflows to run TypeScript type checking without blocking webpack compilation. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build environment. Similar webpack TypeScript plugins include fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin (original non-alt version).",
