  "notes": "Formidable is a Node.js form parsing library for handling multipart/form-data, especially file uploads, in traditional Node.js HTTP servers (http.createServer). Requires node:os module which is not supported in Workers nodejs_compat (only crypto, fs, path, buffer, stream, events, util, http, https, net, dns, zlib, timers, url, assert, process, diagnostics_channel, async_hooks are supported). Designed for Node.js request/response objects and filesystem-based temporary file storage during upload processing. Workers uses Request/Response objects and has better alternatives for form parsing.",
  "alternative": "Workers Request.formData() API (native multipart/form-data parsing built-in), or busboy (lower-level multipart parser that may work with Workers)",
