  "notes": "DEPRECATED! Package renamed to @octokit/rest. The 'github' package is the old GitHub API client library that has been superseded by @octokit/rest which is the official GitHub REST API client for Node.js/browser maintained by GitHub. Provides comprehensive GitHub API integration: repositories (create/read/update/delete), issues/PRs (list/create/comment/merge), users/orgs (profiles/memberships), gists (create/update), notifications, search, git data operations. @octokit/rest has better TypeScript support, active maintenance, OAuth2/token authentication, pagination helpers, rate limit handling, and webhooks support. Works in Node.js and browsers with fetch API. Similar GitHub API libraries include @octokit/graphql (GraphQL API), octonode (alternative client), github-api (community client).",
