  "notes": "grunt-cli is the command-line interface for Grunt, a JavaScript task runner. Provides the 'grunt' CLI command for running Gruntfiles that define build tasks (concatenation, minification, linting, unit testing, compilation). Used during development/build workflows, not runtime execution. Requires process.argv for CLI argument parsing, process.stdin/stdout for terminal I/O, and filesystem access for reading Gruntfiles and task configurations. Part of the Grunt ecosystem alongside grunt (task runner core), grunt-contrib-* plugins (build tasks). Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build environment. Similar task runners include gulp (streaming build system), npm scripts (package.json scripts), webpack CLI.",
