  "notes": "Official Grunt plugin for watching files and running tasks when they change. Part of grunt-contrib-* ecosystem. Configured in Gruntfile.js as grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch') with task configuration defining files to watch and tasks to run on changes. Requires filesystem access (fs.watch, fs.stat) to monitor file/directory changes during development workflows (auto-running tasks on file save, live reload, continuous testing, build automation). Used by build tools, dev servers, and CI workflows. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment without filesystem watching capability, not a build environment.",
