  "notes": "Gulp plugin for image optimization during build workflows. The name pattern 'gulp-*' indicates it's a Gulp plugin (like gulp-babel, gulp-concat, gulp-uglify). Configured in gulpfile.js as part of Gulp's streaming build system (gulp.src('images/**').pipe(imagemin()).pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))). Used during development/build workflows to automatically optimize images (compress PNG/JPG/GIF/SVG files, reduce file sizes) for production. Processes image files from disk using Node.js streams and filesystem access. Part of the Gulp plugin ecosystem alongside gulp-autoprefixer, gulp-concat, gulp-uglify. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment without filesystem access, not a build environment. Modern image optimization uses imagemin CLI directly, build tools with image optimization plugins (webpack/vite with image-minimizer-webpack-plugin), or cloud image optimization services (Cloudflare Images, Cloudinary).",
