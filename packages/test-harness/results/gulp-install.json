  "notes": "Gulp plugin for automatically installing npm/bower dependencies when package.json/bower.json files are detected in Gulp streams. Configured in gulpfile.js as part of Gulp's streaming build system (gulp.src('package.json').pipe(install())). Used during development/build workflows to automatically run 'npm install' or 'bower install' when dependency files change. Requires filesystem access (reading package.json, executing npm/bower commands via child_process) and process execution. Part of the Gulp plugin ecosystem. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment without filesystem access or package installation capability, not a build environment. Modern dependency installation uses npm/yarn/pnpm CLI directly.",
