  "notes": "gulp-minify-css is a Gulp plugin for minifying CSS during build workflows. The 'gulp-*' prefix indicates it's part of the Gulp plugin ecosystem (like gulp-concat, gulp-uglify, gulp-sass, gulp-autoprefixer, gulp-clean-css). Configured in gulpfile.js as part of Gulp's streaming build system. Used during development/build workflows to minify CSS files for production. Requires filesystem access to read source CSS files and write minified output. Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment, not a build environment. Modern CSS minification uses clean-css CLI directly (without Gulp), build tools with built-in minification (webpack/vite), or PostCSS with cssnano.",
