  "notes": "gulp-plumber is a Gulp plugin for error handling in build pipelines. The name pattern 'gulp-*' indicates it's a Gulp plugin (like gulp-if, gulp-babel, gulp-concat, gulp-uglify). Configured in gulpfile.js as part of Gulp's streaming build system (gulp.src('*.js').pipe(plumber()).pipe(uglify()).pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))). Prevents pipe breaking on errors during build workflows - when a task fails (e.g., syntax error in JS file being uglified), plumber() catches the error and allows the stream to continue instead of crashing the entire pipeline. Used during development/build workflows to improve developer experience (prevents watch mode from stopping on errors, allows build to continue past non-critical failures, provides better error reporting). Requires Gulp's streaming build system and filesystem access (reading/writing files through streams). Part of the Gulp plugin ecosystem alongside gulp-watch (file watching), gulp-notify (desktop notifications), gulp-util (deprecated utility functions). Not applicable to Workers which is a runtime environment without Gulp build system or filesystem access, not a build environment. Modern error handling uses build tool native features (webpack error handling, vite error overlay) or on-error packages for stream error handling.",
