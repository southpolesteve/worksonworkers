  "category": "cli",
  "notes": "Ora is a CLI spinner for terminal applications. It requires TTY access (process.stdout/stderr) which is not available in Workers. Additionally, the current version fails to import due to its dependency cli-spinners using import attributes syntax (`import './spinners.json' with {type: 'json'}`) which Workers bundler doesn't support yet. Even if the import issue were fixed, ora is designed for CLI tools, not serverless functions.",
  "errorMessage": "Unrecognized import attributes specified",
  "alternative": "For logging in Workers, use console.log() or structured logging libraries. Progress indicators don't make sense in serverless request/response context.",
